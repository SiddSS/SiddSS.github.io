Hi,
Hope you are doing well, and thanks for stopping by !

I am actively looking for full-time SDE roles starting from May 2024. Kindly let me know if you have any leads.
Here's a brief Introduction for me - 

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech, pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science. I have experience in Software Development, machine learning and optimization. I have done a number of development projects involving Python, C++ and JavaScript. Modeling real world problems into mathematical models and then finding clever ways of solving them is something that I truly enjoy. I have leveraged my coding skills while interning at MathWorks this summer and for six months in 2021, where I wrote production quality, scalable code in multiple major projects.
My hobbies are playing basketball and debating. Feel free to have a strong opinion on any topic conversing with me, always interested in learning multiple perspectives on any topic :)

<!-- Hi! My name is Siddharth Singh Solanki.

I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at GeorgiaTech.

I am interested in the fields of **Machine Learning, Speech Processing** and **Computational Neuroscience**.

I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing projects and other random thoughts.

If in a hurry, you can have a look at my [CV]({{site.url}}/cv).

I blog about my experiences [here]({{site.url}}/blog.html). -->
